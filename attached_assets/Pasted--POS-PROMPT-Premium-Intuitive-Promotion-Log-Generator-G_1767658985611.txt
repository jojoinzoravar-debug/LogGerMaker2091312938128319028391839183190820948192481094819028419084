# **POS PROMPT — Premium Intuitive Promotion Log Generator (GitHub Pages)**

You are building a **luxury-grade, fully animated, highly intuitive static web application** deployable on **GitHub Pages**.

This is a **real internal staff tool**, not a demo or form builder.

A first-time user must understand how to use it **within 10 seconds without instructions**.

---

## **NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES**

* Static only (HTML, CSS, JS)
* GitHub Pages compatible
* No backend, no auth, no database
* 60fps animations
* Zero confusion
* Guided, step-by-step flow
* Output must exactly match staff log formatting

---

## **VISUAL & MOTION STANDARD**

* Dark, executive, command-center aesthetic
* Subtle gradients, depth, glass panels
* Rounded cards, soft glow accents
* Motion everywhere:

  * Hover
  * Focus
  * Click
  * Drag
  * Drop
  * Section transitions
* Animations must **communicate meaning**, not decoration
* Nothing appears abruptly

---

## **APP FLOW (CRITICAL)**

* Sections unlock progressively
* Only the current task is visually emphasized
* Completed sections collapse automatically
* Primary action button is disabled until valid

## **PROMOTION TEAM — CORE FEATURE**

### **Preloaded User Pool (Fixed Ranks)**

Each user appears as a **clickable card** with username + rank badge:

```
opgamercd — BDT
xDylx_n — BoG
ishhjgd — CAC
xEli_te2006 — BDT
jaysonplaysvieo — BoG
jojoinzoravar — CoS
martboy45 — CoS
Seraphable_sama — PC
xMist_y — BDT
XxDarkPrinceXxxx — BoG
```

---

### **Selection Behavior**

* Clicking a card:

  * Adds the user to a **Selected Order** panel
  * Locks username + rank together
  * Assigns an animated order number (1st, 2nd, 3rd…)
* Selected users:

  * Are **drag-and-drop reorderable**
  * Reorder with smooth animated transitions
* Removing a user is one click and reversible

---

### **Custom User**

* Button: **+ Add Custom Reviewer**
* Modal inputs:

  * Username
  * Rank
* Custom users behave **identically** to predefined users

---

## **PROMOTEE DETAILS**

Unlocks after reviewers are selected:

* Their Username
* Old Rank → New Rank

  * Animated directional arrow
* Reason (default: `Activity Recognized!`)

---

## **FACTORS OF DETERMINATION (GUIDED WRITING)**

Instead of one textbox:

* Four expandable sections:

  1. Departments / Department Rank(s)
  2. Leave of Absence
  3. Infraction History / Status
  4. Reformation Status
* Each section:

  * Contains a one-line prompt
  * Expands on click
  * Collapses when filled
